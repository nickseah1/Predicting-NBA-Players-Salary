# Predicting-NBA-Players-Salary

## Introduction
The purpose of this project is to use NBA statistics from 1950-2017 to predict NBA player's salary. 
We will determine which players are being underpaid, and which players are being overpaid.

## Data

Data is NBA data from 1950-2017 from: https://www.kaggle.com/whitefero/nba-players-advanced-season-stats-19782016?select=NBA+Players+-+Advanced+Season+Stats+%281978-2016%29.xlsx


# Methodology
The model was trained using data from 2000-2017 because the NBA has changed drastically since the 90s

We used Linear Regression and Random Forest Regression for our Machine Learning Algorithms.

We used Random Search CV for Hyperparameter tuning

We were able to achieve an RMSE of 0.06
